#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Install NGINX web server
# Requirements:
#   Install nginx on your web-01
#   server
#   Nginx should be listening on port 80
#   When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page)
#    using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
#   As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine
#    to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
#   You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx

# Installs nginx server
apt-get update
apt-get -y install nginx

# add to firewall
ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'

# Append hello world to file
echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html

# start nginx server
service nginx start
