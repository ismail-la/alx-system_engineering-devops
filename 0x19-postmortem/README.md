### 0x19. Postmortem
### Postmortem: Outage on November 7, 2023
#### Issue Summary
The Apache web server experienced an outage from 2:00 PM to 3:15 PM GMT on November 7, 2023.
 During this period, the server returned a 500 error, impacting all users trying to access our web service.
 The root cause was a misconfiguration in the Apache configuration file.
#### Timeline
2:00 PM: The issue was detected when our internal monitoring system alerted us about the server error.
2:05 PM: Our engineering team started investigating the issue, initially suspecting a network problem.
2:20 PM: After ruling out network issues, the team focused on server configurations.
2:45 PM: The team identified a misconfiguration in the Apache configuration file as the potential cause.
3:00 PM: The issue was escalated to the senior DevOps engineer who confirmed the misconfiguration.
3:15 PM: The configuration was corrected, and the server was back online.
#### Root Cause and Resolution
 The root cause of the issue was a syntax error in the Apache configuration file.
 This error caused the server to misinterpret requests, resulting in a 500 error.
 The issue was resolved by correcting the syntax error and restarting the Apache service.
#### Corrective and Preventive Measures
To prevent such issues in the future, we plan to:
Implement a configuration management system using Puppet to automate server configurations and prevent manual errors.
Enhance our monitoring system to check for server configuration changes and alert for potential misconfigurations.
Conduct regular audits of our server configurations to detect and fix issues proactively.
#### Tasks
Set up a Puppet module for Apache configuration management.
Extend monitoring system to include configuration checks.
Schedule bi-weekly server configuration audits.
