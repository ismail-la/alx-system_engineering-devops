## Description

This project aims to explore the inner workings of the web stack, specifically focusing on what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter. It delves into the crucial components of the web infrastructure, including DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.

## Background Context

As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, understanding the intricacies of the web stack is essential. This project offers an opportunity to explain a complex process in a simple and comprehensive manner.

## Requirements

- General:
  - Post your blog post on a platform of your choice (e.g., Medium or LinkedIn).
  - Create a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder to provide essential information about your project.
  - The blog post and `README.md` must be written in English.

- Manual QA Review:
  - It is your responsibility to request a review of your blog post from a peer before the project's deadline. If no peers have reviewed it, you should request a review from a TA or staff member.
